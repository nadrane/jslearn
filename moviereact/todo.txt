/// To-do

1. When deleting movie or user, delete all corresponding reviews - app crashes if you try to get user reviews for deleted films
2. Only send relevant fields from DB. e.g. when logging in and sending user info to session in React, don't need to send "createdAt" "updatedAt" etc.
3. Add front-end and server side form validation for login/register forms?

/// Questions

1. If you use empty objects instead of NULL, what if you need to access props of that object before component mounting?
