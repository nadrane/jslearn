/// To-do

1. Only send relevant fields from DB. e.g. when logging in and sending user info to session in React, don't need to send "createdAt" "updatedAt" etc.
2. Add front-end and server side form validation for login/register forms?

/// Questions

1. Is the way I've handled server errors appropriate? Is there a cleaner/more granular way to do this? (e.g. like my own specific error codes if a user doesn't provide a valid email, leaves something blank, etc.)
