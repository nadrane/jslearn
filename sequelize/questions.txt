1. I think this is correct, but want to confirm: when we require a file like db/index.js in our main app.js file, and then require it again in a route like routes/movies.js, the entire file is run the first time it is required (regardless of what we export). Then, when it is required again within a route, the entire db/index.js file is NOT run, but we do get access to whatever was required via modules.export. If an object is instantiated when db/index.js first runs, and we access it via require in a route, we get the exact same instance of the object, correct? E.g. if a connection pool is opened in db/index.js, it is the same connection pool accessed within a router, and not created anew each time?

2. In movies route, for get /film, I couldn't figure out how to add a sub-query to the first Movie query, so that you are returning the movie you are looking for + it's average rating
