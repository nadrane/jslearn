// Several spots on front-end where I have links as, e.g. href="/tweets/user?id={{ users[tweet.u_id].id }}"> --- When I changed my routing at one point, I had to go through and update every link. Is there a smarter way to do that?
// auth.js - see console.log: query returns anon object & remains anon when assigned to session var?
// TODO/Question: tweets.js /user route: forwarding err to main app.js handler?
// placement of client.end() calls (e.g. tweet.js /user route)
