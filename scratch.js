// Homework

// look up lodash, go through and implement lodash function (map, function, reuce, filter, etc)
// specific ones - look at sort,look for things that have a predicate
// always use const, look at links re: scope of let/const/var

// when get bored, implement all recursively

// Work through chapter 11 of eloquentJS

// after 11, nick has an exercise to implement a regex engine

// write a json parser (a recursive descent parser)

// then eloquent through ch 15

// solve game of life in 2 ways - 1 is storing state in dom itself (data attirbutes), & storing state in javascript
